# Framework

The framework is a pre-compiled version of Justify Grid. It comes in different
flavors. The default version only includes span classes and the extended version
includes push, pull, prepend and append classes as well. They are all based on
columns 4em wide and gutter 2.5em wide and include support for old Internet
Explorer (6&7) with the exception of the last flavor, 'light'. This version
drops support for old Internet Explorer and weighs less than 500 bytes!
